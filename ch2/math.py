#In Python any number with a decimal is a float, it will convert on it's own but it's best to include a decimal if that's what you want
#Python3 handles this automatically but Python2 will not return the decimal values unless you've set the right types
print(5/2)      # This works and gives the right answer as it converted the result to a float of 2.5, Python2 would return 2 as the answer
print(5.0/2)      # Making sure my result will be in float due to the 5.0, Python2 would correctly return 2.5 as the answer here.
